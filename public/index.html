    <h1>CP3402/CP5637 - Assignment 1 - Startup</h1>
    <p><strong>Chris Breed</strong></p>
    <h2>Goal/s</h2>
    <p>Briefly and clearly describe the measurable goal/s of your website here.</p>
    <p><em>What's that plant?</em> is an app that asks you questions about a plant, which you answer and can determine what the plant you're looking at is.<br>A measurable goal would be tracking the number of people that click on the download button, measuring interest in the app.</p>
    <h2>Links</h2>
    <p>Add URLs (and modify CMS names if you've used different CMSs).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Wordpress site: <a href="wp">https://christopherb.sgedu.site/wp/</a></li>
        <li>Joomla site: <a href="joomla">https://christopherb.sgedu.site/joomla</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Plugins</h2>
    <p>List what plugins you used with their URLs and a very brief description of what you used them for.<br> It should be obvious from this how/where they are used on your site.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Wordpress site: SiteBuilder - <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-sitebuilder/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-sitebuilder/</a> - A drag and drop site builder with lots of inbuilt functionality to structure a wordpress site. </li>
        <li>Wordpress site: ScrollToAnchor - <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/scroll-to-anchor/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/scroll-to-anchor/</a> - Easy scrolling to anchors set on the page.</li>
        <li>Joomla site: Smart Slider 3 - <a href="https://smartslider3.com/free-joomla-slider/">https://smartslider3.com/free-joomla-slider/</a> - A header slider option for Joomla, chosen to mimic how the wordpress site was presented. Can be customised to have buttons and text.</li>
        <li>Joomla site: SP Simple YouTube - <a href="https://www.joomshaper.com/joomla-extensions/simple-youtube">https://www.joomshaper.com/joomla-extensions/simple-youtube</a> - A module for embeding YouTube videos into a page.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Reflection and Insights</h2>
    <p>Describe your experience using the two different CMSs.<br> What have you learned through this assignment regarding the different systems?</p>
    <p>They both took a bit of time getting used to and finding my way around the interfaces.<br>
    I found that it isn't difficult to use either, and there are plugin's and extension's that allow for a lot of functionality to be copied between CMS's.</p>
